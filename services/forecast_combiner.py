"""
Forecast Combiner — Weighted combination of trading rules with FDM.

Implements Carver Chapter 8 'Combined Forecasts':

1. Each trading rule variation produces a forecast (avg abs ≈ 10, ±20).
2. Forecasts are combined via a weighted average.
3. The combined forecast is multiplied by a Forecast Diversification
   Multiplier (FDM) to restore the average absolute value to ≈ 10.
4. The final combined forecast is capped at ±20.

Forecast Weights (handcrafted, Carver Table 45):
  - For swing/positional equity with 3 EWMAC + 1 Carry + 1 Screener:
    EWMAC(16,64)  : 22%   (swing core)
    EWMAC(32,128) : 17%   (lower weight — highly correlated with neighbours)
    EWMAC(64,256) : 22%   (positional core)
    Carry         : 22%   (decorrelated fundamental signal)
    Screener      : 17%   (existing technical/methodology overlay)
  - Weights sum to 100%.

FDM Calculation:
  - From correlation matrix of forecast returns (Carver Table 18).
  - With 5 rules at avg correlation ~0.35, FDM ≈ 1.35.
  - Capped at 2.0 maximum.
